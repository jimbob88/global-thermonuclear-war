# Global Thermonuclear War

Homage to the film [Wargames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WarGames)

A recreation of the [scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXzNo0vR_dU&t=92) where David and Jennifer first interact with the WOPR.

Thanks to George Phillips for his [ASCII recreation](http://48k.ca/wgascii.html) of the maps used in the menu.

You can also watch a play through on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R65BBGmOPdw).
